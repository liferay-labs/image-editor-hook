<h1>Image Editor Hook</h1>

<p>This hook enables you to edit .jpeg and .png files using the Liferay Document Library interface.</p>

<p>It's using a new library for AlloyUI that is currently been developed by <a href="https://github.com/jbalsas">@jbalsas</a>.</p>

<p>For modern browsers it uses HTML5 capabilities and flash as fallback for old browsers</p> 

<p>Current editing capabilities are:<p>

<ul>
 	<li>Brightness, contrast, saturation control</li>
 	<li>Select filter</li>
 	<li>X and Y mirroring</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to use:</h2>

<p>Once this hook is deployed is very easy to use. You only have to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>View the image:
		<img src="https://github.com/liferay-labs/image-editor-hook/blob/master/image_editor_1.png?raw=true" alt="Image view page" />
	</li>
	<li>Click in the edit image icon placed in the left bottom corner of the image. Edit controls will appear. Change the image as you wish:
		<img src="https://github.com/liferay-labs/image-editor-hook/blob/master/image_editor_2.png?raw=true" alt="Image view page with controls and with a modified image" />
	</li>
	<li>Save the image. A new version of the file will be created and the page will be realoaded showing it:
		<img src="https://github.com/liferay-labs/image-editor-hook/blob/master/image_editor_3.png?raw=true" alt="Image view page with the modified image" />
	</li>
</ul>
